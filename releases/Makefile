# To release a new version of this package:
#    - Increment the version number
#    - Run make
#    - Check in the updated package_modulo_index.json file and generated .zip file
#
# We can't use the zip files generated by github for a release because
# they are generated dynamically and the checksum can change.
# It's rather annoying that arduino requires a checksum, to be honest.
